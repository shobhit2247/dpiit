The Government of India's flagship programme, the Startup India Scheme, was introduced in 2016. Via this effort, the government hopes to empower startups to develop through innovation and design. Startup India's mission is to produce and innovate goods and services while also boosting jobs in India. Eligible enterprises can be classified as Startups by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (Dpiit startup registration) to have access to a variety of tax perks, simpler compliance, IPR fast-tracking, and other benefits under the Startup India initiative. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (Dpiit startup registration) is in charge of coordinating the Startup India initiative's execution with other government agencies. The Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) is the operational agency for the Fund of Funds for Startups, while DPIIT is the monitoring agency (FFS).

The imposition of tax on this extra consideration is an exemption accessible to a registered startup. This exemption is especially useful during the stage of an angel/venture capital round, when the angel or VC invests in excess of the fair market value.
 
Section 80-IAC tax exemption
For the first ten years after its formation, a registered startup can get an exemption from paying income tax for three years in a row.
